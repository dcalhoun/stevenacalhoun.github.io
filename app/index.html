      <div class="bio">
          I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Graphics at Georgia Institue of Technology.
          In the past year, I have become interested in video game design and the development of graphics engines.
          In addition to those, I am interested in the development of electric vehicles and renewable energy.
          My hope is that my Computer Graphics specialization will allow me to work in these fields.
          I have had the opportuinity to work at several different companies while being a student, and I currently work for FireEye, Inc.
