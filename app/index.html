        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As an engineer I love two things: problem solving and learning.
          Currently I am employed at FireEye, Inc. as I pursue my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
          Both school and work have given me opportunities to hone my skills as a Software Engineer.
          With a Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree and a Computer Science Graphics Master's degree, I believe I am quite versatile in the world of software engineering.
        </p>

          I have recently developed a very strong passion for space exploration.
          This field represents an awesome engineering challenge and the chance to learn and work with engineers of different discplines.
          The space industry is seeing a level of exceitement that it hasn't since the Apollo missions, and I  want to be a part of it.
