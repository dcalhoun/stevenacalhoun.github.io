      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a currently a Computer Engineer major pursuing a bachelor’s degree at Mississippi State University. As an engineer, I am naturally passionate about solving people’s problems. I believe software development is a great way to do that. Through my education and my time working as a co-op at Adtran, Inc., I have honed those development skills so that I can build better solutions. In addition to my passion for software development, I also enjoy music and photography.
