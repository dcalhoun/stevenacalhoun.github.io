      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As an engineer I love two things: problem solving and learning. Currently I am employed at FireEye, Inc. as I pursue my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Both school and work have given me opportunities to hone my skills as a Software Engineer. With a Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree and a Computer Science Graphics Master's degree, I believe I am quite versatile in the world of software engineering.

        One of my newly developed passions is space exploration. This field represents an awesome engineering challenge and the chance to learn and work with engineers of different disciplines. I am hoping to one day work in this field and I believe my bakground would enable me to do so.
        My goal is to one day work in this area, and I believe my background would enable me to do so.

          SECON was my senior design project for my undergraduate CPE program. The IEEE hosts a robotics competition every year at their SouthEastern Conference. The year that I competed the challenge was to design and build an autonomous robot that could navigate a course and play games along the way. I was part of a team of six, and the project lasted a year. My primary role on the team was to develop the software to navigate and play each game. I designed an architecture to allow simple usage of robotic elements then used that architecture to accomplish the higher level tasks.

          Frackers was a semester long group project for my Data and Visual Analytics class. The goal of this project was to investigate the relationship between hydraulic fracking for natural gas and water pollution. My team of four used large amounts of publicly available data from government and non-profit websites. We had to clean the data, analyze the data, then visualize the data. My responsibility was to design and develop the visualization. I created a simple Ruby on Rails application to serve our data in JSON format. This JSON data was served to a web app that displayed a heat map of ground water pollution overlaid with fracking sites.

          Geoplay is a small 2D platforming game I created for a short Game Design course. The game has a simple objective: collect the triangles while avoiding various types of harmful rain drops. Different powerups spawn randomly to help the player while each level gets progressively more difficult in terms of level design and frequency of rain drops. The game was built in Python, using Pygame to help with the graphical needs.

          This was my final project for a Computational Photography class. This was an easy and common project but still had some cool results. The goal was to use a Raspberry Pi to control a camera and a solenoid valve in order to photograph droplets of water interacting with each other. The code and setup was relatively simple, but finding the precise time delays between each step in the process took a lot of time. As a result, I was able to capture many interesting photos using water and milk of different colors.
