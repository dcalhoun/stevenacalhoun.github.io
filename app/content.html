      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        As an engineer I love two things: problem solving and learning. Currently I am employed at FireEye, Inc. as I pursue my Master's degree in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Both school and work have given me opportunities to hone my skills as a Software Engineer. With a Computer Engineering Bachelor's degree and a Computer Science Graphics Master's degree, I believe I am quite versatile in the world of software engineering.

        I have recently developed a very strong passion for space exploration. This field represents an awesome engineering challenge and the chance to learn and work with engineers of different discplines. The space industry is seeing a level of exceitement that it hasn't since the Apollo missions, and I  want to be a part of it.

        <h3>SECON</h3>
        <h4>IEEE Robotics Competition</h4>
        <p>
          SECON was my senior design project for my undergraduate CPE program. The IEEE puts on a robotics competition every year at their SoutheEastern Conference. The year I competed the challenge was to design and build an autonomous robot that could navigate a course and play games along the way. I was part of a team of six and the project lasted a year. My primary role on the team was to develop the software to navigate and play each game. I designed an architecture to allow simple useage of robotic elements.

        <h3>Frackers</h3>
        <h4>Investigation of Hydraulic Fracking Pollution</h4>
        <p>
          Frackers was a semester long group project for my Data and Visual Analytics class during my CS Masters program. The goal of this project was to investigate the relationship between hydraulic fracking for natural gas and water polution. My team of four used large amounts publicly available data from government and non-profit websites. We had to clean the data, analyze the data, then visualize the data. My responsibility was to design and the develop the visualization. I created a simple Ruby on Rails application to serve our data in JSON format. This JSON data was served to web app that displayed a heat map of ground water pollution overlayed with fracking sites.

        <h3>Geoplay</h3>
        <h4>2D Platforming Game</h4>
        <p>
          Geoplay is a small 2D platforming game I created for a short Game Design course. The game has a pretty simple object, collect the triangles while avoiding various types of harmful rain drops. Various powerups spawn randomly to help the player while each level gets progressively more difficult in terms of design and frequency of rain drops. The game was built in Python, using Pygame to help with the graphical needs.

        <h3>Water Droplet Photography</h3>
        <h4>High Speed Photography of Water Droplet Collisions</h4>
        <p>
          This was my final project for a Computational Photography calss. This was a pretty simple and well known project, but still had some cool results. The goal was to control a camera and a solenoid valve, with a Raspberry Pi, to photograph  droplets of water interacting with each other. The code and setup was reltively simple, but find the precise timings for each step in the process took a lot of time. I ended up being able to capture a bunch of interesting photos using water and milk of different colors.
